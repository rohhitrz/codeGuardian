# ✅ LICENSE VERIFICATION - You're All Set!

## 🎯 What "OSI-Approved License" Means

**OSI = Open Source Initiative** (https://opensource.org)

They maintain a list of licenses that meet the Open Source Definition. When Kiroween says "OSI-approved license," they mean:

❌ **NOT**: Get your license approved by OSI (no approval process needed!)
✅ **YES**: Use a license that's already on OSI's approved list

Think of it like choosing a paint color from a pre-approved palette - you just pick one from the list!

---

## ✅ Your Current Setup (PERFECT!)

### 1. LICENSE File ✅
**Location**: `/LICENSE` (root of project)
**Type**: MIT License (OSI-approved ✅)
**Status**: Complete and correct

```
MIT License

**Why MIT?**

### 2. package.json ✅
**License field**: `"license": "MIT"`
**Status**: Correct

### 3. README.md ✅
**License section**: Mentions MIT
**Status**: Documented

## 🔍 How GitHub Will Display It

When you push to GitHub, it will automatically:

1. **Detect the LICENSE file**
2. **Show "MIT License" badge** in the About section
3. **Display license info** at the top of the repo
4. **Make it visible to judges**

Example of what judges will see:
```
